#### This article will show how to configure dmvpn HUB and spoke topology.

###### What is FVRF ?

In my experience FVRF or front door vrf is where you place your public facing physical interface or an interface facing your L3VPN inside a VRF. I mainly encounter this setup in DMVPN environments. I will be sharing in this article on how we setup a hub and spoke dmvpn using fvrf.  

Basically a vrf is a separate routing table from your global routing table. The tunnel interface will not be put inside a vrf but instead it should only be aware on where to forward the traffic correcly (vrf aware vpn).
